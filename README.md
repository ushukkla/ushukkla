- ⚡ Fun fact: There was neither death nor immortality then. There was not distinction of day or night. That alone breathed windless by its own power. Other than that there was
not anything else. Darkness was hidden by darkness in the beginning. All this was an indistinguishable sea. That which becomes, that which was enveloped by the void, that alone was born through the power of heat.
